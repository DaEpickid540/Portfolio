Sarvin’s Developer Portfolio
Welcome to my personal portfolio — a clean, modern, and slightly dramatic corner of the internet where I showcase my projects, my skills, and my obsession with red‑and‑black UI themes. Built from scratch with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and a whole lot of customization, this site represents who I am as a developer: detail‑oriented, creative, and always leveling up.
